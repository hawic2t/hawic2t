### :woman_technologist: About Me :
Hi, I’m Shirley.
A professional problem solver who is dedicated, challenge oriented and resourceful to make results happen. I connect with people easily and like to listen to people’s problems and offer advice and solutions. I’m a Founder who leads with empathy, resourcefulness and dedication to make results happen. My MO is being an avid communicator in both the technical and non-technical realm of cyber security.

I started my cyber security journey in 2021 on the forefront before the industry boom in Australia. Thanks to the US connections from Cybrary and Grant Collins' Cyber Academy and my studies at Melbourne Institute of TAFE in cyber security and networking. 

I got into the cyber security field, as at it's core: it's about protecting people, information and assets and I relish in being constantly challenged to grow and evolve on a daily basis. And you get to do it as a team sport!

- 💻: **Motto:** _Cyber security isn't just an industry, it's a way of life._

- 👩‍🎓:Graduated with a Certificate III in ICT: Cyber security, governance, risk and compliance, ICT consulting, networking, programming (Python) and system admin.

- 🫡: In my free time, I love to continue learning, sharing and growing in the CS community by volunteering as a mentor for Australian Women in Security Network (AWSN), pitching in for cyber events and seminars and meet ups both as an attendee and a guest speaker. The latest book or podcast about the latest industry trends or CTF is never too far from my book shelf or laptop.

- 🗺️: Involved in US based cyber security organisations, in particular with the National CyberSecurity Alliance for Cyber security awareness month and Data Privacy week.

### 💬: Communities I'm a part of:

- :star:**WeWork and Stone & Chalk:** Proactive member in co-working spaces to make connections, collaboration and meet potential clients and referrals with fellow start ups in legal and technology. I meet regularly with WeWork members to share stories, latest updates and all the highs and lows of braving the industry (it's not as glamourous as it seems but the ride is worth it with great company by your side!). While at Stone & Chalk, I'm in the early days of building a similar community around me.
  
- 🌃: **Cyber Collective, Advocate (Volunteer)**: A non-profit organisation that is dedicated to promote internet safety and cyber security awareness. Volunteer work groups include: development, launch, engagement and impact for an upcoming Internet Street Smarts course.

- 🗨️: **Cyber Security Tech Meet-up**: hosted by yours truly at HA.WIC for colleagues in the field to discuss latest topics, projects and trends in industry, share ideas and knowledge.

 ### 🏙️: Upcoming projects and events (with more on the way):

- :star: **National Missing Person Hackathon September 2024**: Assisted as a case manager to review submitted case evidence and provide commentary and guidance to teams.
- 📝: **Year of a She-Oh Book**: 30 lessons learnt in the year of my start up journey as a female CEO/Founder. Working in the midst of my first draft amongst running a company, studying and everything else in between!

**October 2024**
